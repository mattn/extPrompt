Description: This package enables embedding time in the R prompt by treating
   the options()$prompt string as a strftime format string. The package
   contains a C library which replaces the default R_ReadConsole function. This
   is the function responsible for reading one line of input when R is running
   in interactive mode.
Depends: R (>= 3.0.2)
